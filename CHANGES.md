# Changes

## 0.2.1-1 (2018-03-05)

- Same as 0.2.1, but made functions public

## 0.2.1 (2018-03-05)

- Same as 0.2.1-alpha2

## 0.2.1-alpha2 (2018-02-26)

- Add support for `:gup` to the `:elem-with-data` piece, which *can* be used **instead of** using `:did-mount` and `:did-update`.

*gup*, allow you to explicitly set attributes and add transitions in the `:enter-init`, `:enter`, `:update`, and `:exit` parts of the [general update pattern](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3808234).

As an aside, the traditional `:did-mount` and `:did-update` only give you access to the update part of the general update pattern (with a sane way of handling enter and exit for you).

- Add `rid3->` macro to api. To include it:

```clojure
(ns foo.bar
  (:require [rid3.core :as rid3 :refer [rid3->]]))
```

The purpose of `rid3->` is to be able to use a hiccup-like attribute map when setting attributes on a node.  For example

```clojure
 (fn [node ratom]
  (rid3-> node
	 {:fill "grey"
	  :text-anchor "middle"
	  :style {:font-weight 400}}
	  (.text "some text")))
```

 would be the same as

 ```clojure
(fn [node ratom]
  (-> node
	(.attr "fill" "grey")
	(.attr "text-anchor" "middle")
	(.style "font-weight" 400)
	(.text "some text")))
 ```

## 0.2.1-alpha (2018-02-25)

Don't use this version ... it had introduced an api that was decided against.

## 0.2.0 (2017-09-27)

- add `:key-fn` to `:elem-with-data` piece
- remove `:children` from `:elem` piece
- remove top-level `:prepare-dataset`

### Migrating from 0.1.0-alpha-3?

- If you were using the top-level `:prepare-dataset`, you will need to move it inside all of the `:elem-with-data` pieces.
- If you were using `:children` from within an `:elem` piece, add a `:container` piece and use its `:children` instead

## 0.1.0-alpha-3 (2017-06-14)

- fix broken demo
- move resources to dev-resources, fixes [#3](https://github.com/gadfly361/rid3/issues/3)

## 0.1.0-alpha-2 (2017-05-29)

- rename "main-container" class to "rid3-main-container" to avoid conflicts

## 0.1.0-alpha (2017-05-17)

- initial release
